# Autonomous-UGV-with-2D-RPLidar
 Software for an Autonomous UGV Relying Solely on a 2D RPLidar Sensor: Design Project by Senior METU EEE Students

The project aims to design an Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for indoor and outdoor navigation using a single 2D LiDAR sensor for precise 3D mapping. The UGV will generate maps without manual corrections, featuring advanced perception, planning, and control technologies. It will include a graphical user interface for real-time wireless communication, map visualization, and vehicle control. The UGV will autonomously detect and avoid obstacles, planning the most effective paths. Additionally, its mechanical design will ensure stable motion, accommodate sensors and processors, and prevent mobility failures through rigorous testing.
