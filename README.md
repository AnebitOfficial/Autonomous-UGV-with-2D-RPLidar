# Autonomous-UGV-with-2D-RPLidar
 Software for an Autonomous UGV Relying Solely on a 2D RPLidar Sensor: Design Project by Senior METU EEE Students

The project aims to design an Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for indoor and outdoor navigation using a single 2D LiDAR (RPLiDAR A1-M8) sensor for precise 3D mapping. The UGV will generate maps without any manual corrections. It will include a graphical user interface for real-time wireless communication, map visualization, and vehicle control. The UGV will autonomously detect and avoid obstacles, planning the most effective paths. Additionally, its mechanical design will ensure stable motion, accommodate sensors and processors, and prevent mobility failures through rigorous testing.

You can refer to the poster file for an overall project description or review the final report for a more detailed explanation of the project.

This repository primarily focuses on the software developed by the team and how they integrated it with the existing built-in software.
